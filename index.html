<h1>Diyanah Jilani</h1>
<h3>About me!</h3>
<li>I am a rising third-year majoring in Biology at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia!</li>
<li>I am interested in the synergy of healthcare, technology, social advocacy, and visual arts.</li>
<li>My research interests lie in genetics, protein modification, and health policy.</li>

<h3>Passions + Interests</h3>
<p>I've been making art since I was three, and I love doing traditional art (painting, drawing, charcoal).</p>
<p>I love to bake! I try incorporating my mother's Bangladeshi recipes with American recipes I find online.</p>
<p>I enjoy taking pictures of the sky, and I have a bunch of pictures in my gallery of just that.</p>

<h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
<h4>Summer 2021</h4>
<p>I applied for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program on a whim (encouraged by my older brother!) and got in! This was the first time I was introduced to HTML/CSS and Javascript. I made a website on "Women in Business (e.g. healthcare, finance, and technology)" on how to support women in business and become involved in said career.</p>

<h4>Summer 2022</h4>
<p>I wanted to continue learning how to code, so I applied for Kode With Klossy's Program, and I learned Web Development again. My group made a website called "Work on Change" to educating people and raise awareness of the struggles women of color have to endure in the workplace.</p>
<p>I also participated in Girls Who Code's Self-Paced Program where I learned Python with their Introduction to Cybersecurity course!</p>

<h4>Spring 2024</h4>
<p>Now in college, I took Georgia Tech's Introduction to Computing course where I learned Python. It's required for all majors at GT, but I ended up enjoying the class!</p>

<h4>Summer 2025 (now!)</h5>
<p>This summer, I wanted to get back into coding, so I decided to sign up for the KWK Data Storytelling Challenge!</p>

<h4>Fall 2025</h4>
<p>I am planning on taking R as a part of my Biostatistics and Ecology Lab classes this upcoming fall, and I'm super excited!</p>
